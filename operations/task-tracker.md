## Task Workflow

1. **Identify task** - add to Notion board
2. **Assign owner** - tag in Notion + update this wiki if it is a standing area
3. **Set deadline** - tie to Master Timeline milestones
4. **Track progress** - Notion statuses: `To Do` - `In Progress` - `Blocked` - `Done`
5. **Decisions needed?** - Log in Decision Log
