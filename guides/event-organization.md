## Types of Events

### Meetings

Small scope, project-specific or topic-focused. Can be local or virtual.

**Best practices:**
- Use asynchronous coordination when possible
- Record meetings for those who cannot attend
- Follow up with clear action items

### Workparties

Fun, relaxed sessions where people co-create something together.

**Best practices:**
- Start with a brief to present the problems to solve
- Break into tasks and form groups
- Wrap up with documentation

### Large Events

Presentations, workshops, hackathons, etc.

**Best practices:**
- Plan well in advance
- Get help with logistics
- Document everything

## P2P Event Methodology

### Core Principles

1. **Distributed participation** - Contributions are voluntary and self-directed
2. **Peer interaction** - Participants interact as peers
3. **Commons outputs** - Knowledge and outputs are shared
4. **Participatory governance** - Decision-making is transparent and collective

### Steps

1. Clarify purpose and commons outputs
2. Establish a core group
3. Build collaborative infrastructure
4. Invite role co-definition
5. Define contribution ledger and accounting norms
6. Co-create program content
7. Enable participatory budgeting
8. Facilitate real-time feedback
9. Support reflection and post-event commons

## Key Norms

- **Equipotential engagement** - Evaluate based on task relevance, not credentials
- **Permissionless contribution** - Allow people to join without gatekeeping
- **Negotiated coordination** - Manage conflicts through dialogue
- **Holoptism** - Default to transparency
