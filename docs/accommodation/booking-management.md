## Edge Cases

* **Couples**: Need clarity on double room allocation: If booked as a couple / as sharing bed, this needs explicit mention
* **Late arrivals / early departures**: fixed pricing
* **Room swaps mid-event**: Possible if space allows
* **Overflow**: External accommodation options available: F: yes, mainly Kobald - but we need to prioritize our accommodation
