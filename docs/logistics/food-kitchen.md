# Food and Kitchen

Food is **NOT included** in accommodation or ticket pricing. Expect ~EUR 10/day per person.

---

## Kitchen Model

**Key decision needed:** How do we handle community meals?

### Options

| Model | Pros | Cons |
|-------|------|------|
| **A. Rotating kitchen teams** (enforced) | Fair distribution, community bonding | Enforcement is awkward |
| **B. Rotating kitchen teams** (voluntary) | More flexible | Risk: nobody signs up |
| **C. Fully self-prep** | Zero coordination needed | No community meals |
| **D. Hybrid** - shared dinners + self-prep | Best of both worlds | Still need dinner coordination |
| **E. Catered** - hire local | Professional, reliable | Most expensive |

**Recommended:** Hybrid model - daily community dinners (self-prepped by rotating teams) + self-serve for breakfast and lunch.
