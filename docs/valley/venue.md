# Venue: Commons Hub

As an experimental playground for regenerative systems design, the commons hub explores the liberatory potential of emerging technologies and social techniques that facilitate horizontal communities.

Drawing on years of experience in managing creative chaos, it provides the stability and freedom to let emerging communities bloom. Its facilities are complemented by self-organizing practices, gently guiding creative energy into productive flows.
