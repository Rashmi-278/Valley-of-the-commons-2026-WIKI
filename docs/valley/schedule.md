# Schedule and Timeline

The four-week popup follows a simple rhythm:
- **Mornings** are structured learning paths
- **Afternoons** host workshops, field visits, and working groups
- **Evenings** are reserved for shared life, reflection, and communal time

Weekends remain open for exploration and connection with local initiatives.

## Life Between Sessions

Life happens in between structured programming:
- Shared meals
- Scenic hikes
- River plunges
- Mushroom foraging
- Fire circles
- Late-night conversations under alpine stars

We create these moments together, each contributing their own skills, energy, and quirks to the village.
