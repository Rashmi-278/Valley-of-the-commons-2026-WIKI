# Location: Höllental Valley

Just an hour south of Vienna, Höllental closes the gentle Danube basin with a dramatic landscape of high peaks, steep cliffs, and cold rushing streams framed by dense forests. It feels remote, almost untouched, yet remains remarkably accessible.

## Accessibility

- Nearly **10 million people** live within a three-hour drive
- Vienna's international airport is under **two hours** away by rail

---

## Local Context

Formerly a famed imperial summer retreat and wood-industry hub, the valley spent the last century dormant, its villages slowly decaying.

Recent signs of reversal point to a shift toward outdoor tourism, as hotels renovate and factories close for good. Real estate remains affordable, with many houses and villas still awaiting new purpose.

Adding to its beauty and accessibility, the opportunities on the ground make this valley ideal for building for permanence.
