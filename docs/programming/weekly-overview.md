# Weekly Schedule Overview

The four-week popup follows a simple rhythm:

* **Mornings** are structured learning paths
* **Afternoons** host workshops, field visits, and working groups
* **Evenings** are reserved for shared life, reflection, and communal time

Weekends remain open for exploration and connection with local initiatives.

## Between Sessions

Life happens in between structured programming:

* Shared meals
* Scenic hikes
* River plunges
* Mushroom foraging
* Fire circles
* Late-night conversations under alpine stars



\>>> still gotta schedule some 45min per day for sponsors/partners - probably towards evening, calling it 'golden hour', relaxed atmosphere... only issue: usually workshops take longer than planned.
