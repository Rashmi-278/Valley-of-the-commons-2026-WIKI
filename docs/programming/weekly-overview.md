# Weekly Schedule Overview

The four-week popup follows a simple rhythm:
- **Mornings** are structured learning paths
- **Afternoons** host workshops, field visits, and working groups
- **Evenings** are reserved for shared life, reflection, and communal time

Weekends remain open for exploration and connection with local initiatives.
